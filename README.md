# Event-Management-System

The approach of this project is to create, manage, and track events in a user-friendly and efficient manner. The system focuses on automating event-related tasks like event creation, attendee management, and notifications, while ensuring real-time communication and updates. Users can create new events, specifying event details such as title, description, date, time, and location using event creation. The project allows attendees to accept/decline events from RSVP tracked in real time. Organizers can also send custom notifications or updates to attendees.

What problem I Solved?
1. RSVP Tracking: Tracking attendee responses manually can be time-consuming and error-prone.
Solution: Your system provides real-time RSVP tracking, making it easier to manage and gauge attendance.

2. Notifications: Sending updates and notifications can be disorganized and lack personalization.
Solution: The ability to send custom notifications allows organizers to communicate specific information effectively.

3. Event Updates: Keeping attendees informed about changes or updates can be challenging without an automated system.
Solution: Automated notifications and updates ensure that attendees receive timely and relevant information.
